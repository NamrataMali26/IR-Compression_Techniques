# Compression-Techniques
Implememtaion & comparison of compression techniques in Information Retrievel.

## Dataset Used:
Cranfield collections dataset, it consists of consists of 1400 documents.

## Methods
Areas for Compression in IR Systems:
1. Index Compression
2. Vector Representation Compression
3. Binarization/Quantization/Pruning for LTR Models

Scope of this project : Index and Vector Representation Compression

We have implemented following compression techniques:
Index Compression : 
	1.Dictionary Compression
	2. Postings compression

Embedding Compression:
	1. PCA Dimensionality Reduction
	2. Product Quantization
